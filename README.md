# A Night In

## Proposal
A website that allows the user to create a personalized night in complete with a movie + restaurant of choice. The user will input their zip code, select a streaming service from a dropdown, and select a genre from a dropdown to show local restaurants and available movies. They will be able to favorite any of the restaurants or movies to look back through later. There will also be a list of recent searches.
