# Classifieds Search

## Proposal
A website that allows the user to search for items to purchase from the Craigslist API and the Ebay API. One item from each API will appear on the screen and the user will be able scroll through the list of items from each API. Each item will have a link to its corresponding webpage to purchase the item. We will also try to incorporate a filter (like price or best-sellers) to make it more dynamic and easier for the user to find what they are looking for.
